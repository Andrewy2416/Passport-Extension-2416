## <a name="story">User Story</a>
AS a traveller:
I want to document my experiences to cities I’ve visited
SO THAT others know what to expect when visiting certain destinations.
GIVEN a user creates an account:

WHEN I create/login into an account,
THEN I am presented with the main page with options to document cities I’ve visited, places I want to go, and read user-generated reviews that other users have created for certain cities. I also have access to a search bar that 
WHEN I enter a city I am presented information about the time and weather in that city

WHEN I click My Account,
THEN I am shown a list of my previous posts.

WHEN I want to create a new post,
THEN I am prompted to enter the location I visited, and enter a text describing my travels to said city.

WHEN I want to comment on a post,
THEN I click on comments and it will allow us to comment on a post, and the number of comments on a post will reflect in the main page.

Passport-Extension is a travel blog where users share their experiences, connect with others, and research destinations they want to travel to in the future. Passport-Extension is a fun way to document your travels for yourself, friends, and family. Other users can comment on and react to posts; the comment feature is a great way to ask questions and learn more about different places you want to travel to and get recommendations from people who have been there before. Passport-Extension functions as a useful tool as well as a means to share and connect with a community of fellow lovers of travel.

## <a name=future>Future Plans!</a>

We hope to add more features that help to organize the blog feed like giving users the ability to sort posts by the time they were made, search for posts that feature the particular location they want to visit, or to filter posts by most popular (most reactions or comments) to least popular. With more time we would also like to add more tools for the user to have like a currency converter in addition to the timezone and weather widget on the page. We would also like to implement the google images api to get pictures of locations that users search.
